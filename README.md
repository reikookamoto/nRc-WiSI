**Welcome the nRc-WiSI R coding group!**

This initiative began as a way to share, teach, and learn about R and RStudio within the Women in Science & Innovation group at NRC. We encourage anyone who wants to learn basic coding to join in our sessions, regardless of skill-level! We will begin with a few introductory classes to get new users started, then we will dive into a diverse group of more challenging topics. If you ever have questions throughout the sessions, please use the chat; since we a group of three planning the sessions, two people will always be monitoring the chat to help. The sessions will be in English, but please feel free to ask questions in French in the chat. 

R is an open-source software environment and programming language providing a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques for data analysis, data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. RStudio is a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for working with the R programming language. 

Ideally, you will need to download/install BOTH R and R Studio. Depending on your IT access, you may need to put in a ticket for the installation of these on your NRC computer. Make sure you ask for R AND RStudio. 

To download/install R, download the program applicable to your operating system. 
- https://cran.r-project.org/

To download/install RStudio, download the program applicable to your operating system. The free, open-source is the one that we will be using. 
- https://posit.co/downloads/

To download the scripts and datasets for each session, click the green "Code" button and download the files as zip files. Please use a browser other than Internet Explorer (i.e. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
Unzip the files from your "Downloads" section on your computer, then move the files to the folder you will be using as your working directory. 
If you get lost, do not worry -- I will walk through these steps on our first session!

**R Studio is broken up into 4 different sections**
1) Top left (Source): Where you write and edit scripts
2) Top right (Environment & History): Where you see objects and variables
3) Bottom left (Console): Where you see the results of running a script
4) Bottom right (Files, Plots, Packages, Help): Where you see files in the working directory, resulting plots,and packages to load

These sections are adjustable by hovering cursor on the boundaries of each section and dragging to adjust

**Start a new project**
- In the top right corner, click on the cube with an "R" inside of it
- Select "New Project"
- Select "New Directory"
- Select "New Project"
- Select "Browse" and choose an appropriate folder or make a new folder
- Select "Create Project"

By creating a "project" and working within a "project", it automatically sets the working directory -- so any spreadsheets that you work with can simply be moved to the folder containing the "project" file. Move the provided unzipped files from your downloads into this folder.

**Start a new R script**
- In the top left corner, select the white paper with a green + sign
- Select "R Script"
- To open or import a script, select the yellow folder with the green arrow (top left corner) and select the script you want to open
- To save a script, click the save button --> save your scripts often!
- To run a script, highlight the section of the script you want to run, then click "Run" in the right of the script section
- When writing your scripts, if something is incorrect or incomplete, a little white "x" will be listed beside the lines of code in the script with an error.

**Script in R is case sensitive**
- If a label or variable in an excel sheet you import has capital letters, you need to include capital letters when referring to that label or variable.
- Almost all functions in R are lower case

**Other topics**
- "Code tools" button --> comment/uncomment lines of code
- Environment tab --> clear environment (broom)
- History tab --> clear history (broom)
- Files tab --> shows all of the files that are in the directory you have selected
- Plots tab --> any time you run code that results in a plot, it will appear here
- Packages --> Install and load packages, or click on a specific package to learn more about what is included in that package

**Shortcuts**
- Ctrl + Enter --> Run the current line of code
- Ctrl + A + Enter --> Run all lines of code
- Ctrl + Shift + C --> Comment or uncomment lines
- Ctrl + Shift + M --> %>% (pipes) 

**How to change the appearance of R studio**
- In the top bar, click "Tools". Select "Global Options", then "Appearance" and play around with the RStudio Theme and Editor theme.

R prefers to read CSV files, not regular excel files. So you will notice today, all the spreadsheets we will be working with are in CSV format.
