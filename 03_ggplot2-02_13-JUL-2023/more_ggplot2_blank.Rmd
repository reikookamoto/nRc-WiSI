*I acknowledge that I am calling in from the unceded, unsurrendered Territory of the Anishinaabe Algonquin Nation whose presence here reaches back to time immemorial.*

## ‚ùì Course information

-   *Mostly for those joining us for the first time*

-   Course materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yoitsjenna/nRc-WiSI)

-   Lesson will be recorded and the recording will be shared on Teams

-   Content will be delivered in English but participants can ask questions in the chat or by email in both official languages

-   Request was submitted to Client Services Centre to make R and RStudio available on the Green zone

    -   Alternatives to corporate machines: [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) or personal computer

-   As always, consult your supervisor prior to using R and/or RStudio to develop data products as part of your work

-   üì£ indicates instructions and üí° indicates tips

## üìÜ Upcoming schedule

-   **Introduction to Data Wrangling** - Thursday, July 27th (12:00-13:00 ET)

-   Teams meeting invite will be sent via email and posted on the R Learning Group sub-channel

## ‚è™ What did we discuss last time?

-   [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a file format for making dynamic documents that combine code, its results, and narrative text

-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a data visualization package for declaratively creating graphics

-   Creating a ggplot2 object is like building a layered cake üç∞

    ![](template.PNG){width="500"}

-   Plot types we covered: histogram, scatter plot, line plot, bar plot

## üîÆ Clarifying concepts from last time

-   *What is the difference between editing in source and visual mode?*

    -   In source mode, you need to "knit" each time you make a change to see what your document looks like

    -   Visual mode provides a better experience when working with .md or .Rmd files because you can see changes in real-time and preview your document without re-knitting (similar to editing in Microsoft Word)

    -   Visual mode supports both traditional keyboard shortcuts as well as markdown shortcuts; no need to memorize markdown syntax

    -   Better experience for people who are not familiar with markdown yet or prefer not writing in markdown, but still want to use its features

-   *When do we want to use the pipe?*

    -   The [tidyverse style guide](Use%20%%3E%%20to%20emphasise%20a%20sequence%20of%20actions,%20rather%20than%20the%20object%20that%20the%20actions%20are%20being%20performed%20on.) suggests "[using] `%>%` to emphasize a sequence of actions, rather than the object that the actions are being performed on"

    -   üì£ Calculate the average height of Star Wars characters from Tatooine by species:

```{r pipe-demo}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

-   *What are the differences between the magrittr pipe (`%>%`) and the base R pipe (`|>`)?*

## üçΩÔ∏è Le menu du jour

-   Bar plots (5 min)

-   Changing colors (10 min)

-   Additional plot types (10 min)

-   Changing the look and feel (10 min)

-   Saving our masterpieces (5 min)

## üìä Bar plots (5 min)

üì£ Read the data from last class:

```{r import-data}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° Each row summarizes information on trips from one station to another for a given month and year

üì£ Create a grouped bar plot to compare the number of departures from Paris-Nord in 2015 and 2016, by destination:

```{r bar-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üì£ Create a horizontal bar plot:

```{r h-bar-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## üñåÔ∏è Changing colors (10 min)

üì£ Change colors manually:

```{r change-fill-manual}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° Use `scale_fill_manual()` for bar, box, and violin plots; use `scale_color_manual()` for scatter and line plots. We'll use the latter function in just a bit.

üì£ Change colors using the [RColorBrewer](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html) package:

```{r change-fill-brewer}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üì£ An estimated 2.6 million Canadians are colorblind. Create a colorblind-friendly plot using the RColorBrewer package:

```{r change-fill-colorblind}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## üìà Plots, plots, plots, plots, plots, plots (10 min)

üì£ Create a box plot to show the distribution of the monthly number of trips from Paris-Gare-de-Lyon for each international destination:

```{r box-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üì£ Change one line of code to visualize the distributions using a violin plot:

```{r violin-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

> A violin plot is more informative than a plain box plot. While a box plot only shows summary statistics such as mean/median and interquartile ranges, the violin plot shows the full distribution of the data. The difference is particularly useful when the data distribution is multimodal (more than one peak).

--- [Violin plot - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot#:~:text=A%20violin%20plot%20is%20more,(more%20than%20one%20peak).)

üì£ Create a line plot to show how the monthly number of trips from Paris to multiple cities in Brittany fluctuate over time. Use **facets** to organize multiple line plots into a panel (i.e., one plot for 2015, another for 2016, and so on):

```{r facet}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° Organizing a sequence of panels in this fashion might be an appropriate use of screen space in some cases.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Changing the look and feel (10 min)

üì£ Create a line plot to show how the monthly number of trips from Paris to multiple cities in Brittany fluctuate over time (from last class)

1.  Force the y-axis to start at 0

2.  Add year-month labels to the x-axis and rotate them (Google how to do this)

3.  Apply [pre-existing themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)

4.  Change elements that are specified by the theme (Google how to do this as well)

```{r look-and-feel}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° Modify the theme to customize the non-data components of your plots (e.g., titles, labels, grid lines). Make sure to call `theme_minimal()` before `theme()` or else the modifications you have specified will be overwritten.

üì£ Save and apply our custom theme:

```{r apply-custom-theme}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° A system like this allows us to reproducibly make the same changes across multiple plots with less typing!

## üíæ Saving our masterpieces (5 min)

```{r ggsave}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

üí° By default, if you don't specify the `plot` argument, the function will save the last plot displayed.
